# Cover Letter - Veeva Systems

**Senior Software Engineer - Front End**

---

I'm drawn to Veeva's mission of building software that helps life sciences companies bring treatments to patients faster. As a Public Benefit Corporation, you've committed to balancing stakeholder interests, that resonates with me as someone who's done community work for nonprofits like PICA alongside my engineering career.

At Apex Fintech Solutions, I've spent four years building and maintaining UIs that serve 80,000+ daily users. The "decompose existing systems while influencing architectural improvements" responsibility in your posting describes my exact work—I've been part of three major migrations: Angular to React, Redux to modern state patterns, and REST to GraphQL. Each required careful incremental delivery while keeping production stable.

Testing is central to how I work. I established E2E testing infrastructure with Cypress where none existed, later migrating to Playwright. I moved our unit testing from Jest to Vitest and advocate for React Testing Library patterns across the team. I believe testing isn't overhead—it's how you ship confidently.

Your Java stack requirement—I'll be direct. I haven't written production Java, but I collaborate daily with Java backend engineers on API contracts, integration testing, and debugging cross-stack issues. I understand the integration points and learn tooling quickly; my migration track record demonstrates that.

I've also been part of scaling a team from 7 to 40+ engineers, mentoring new developers and creating onboarding documentation along the way. I know what it takes to maintain velocity while growing.

I'm based in Portland (PST) and looking for a remote-friendly role where I can contribute to meaningful software. Veeva seems like that place.

Thanks for your consideration.
