# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences as a frontend engineer.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **React & TypeScript** - Tips, patterns, and best practices
- **Frontend Architecture** - Building scalable applications
- **Developer Experience** - Tools and workflows that make life easier
- **Career Growth** - Lessons learned along the way

## Why Start a Blog?

Writing helps me solidify my understanding of concepts and hopefully helps others along the way. Stay tuned for more posts!

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Thanks for reading!
