# Building This Blog From My Phone on the Bus

Here's something wild: this entire blog feature was implemented from my phone. No laptop, no desktop—just me on the bus home from work, typing commands into the Claude app.

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator. Blog posts are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX support), which means I can write content in simple markdown files and they automatically become pages on the site.

The whole thing is powered by:
- **Astro** - Fast static site generation
- **MDX** - Markdown files for blog posts
- **Content Collections** - Type-safe frontmatter and easy content management
- **Claude Code** - AI-assisted development

## The Experiment

I wanted to see what a mobile-first development experience could look like. Could I actually build a feature—not just write content, but implement real functionality—from my phone?

Turns out, yes. Using Claude Code through the Claude app, I was able to:
- Add MDX support to the Astro config
- Set up content collections with a proper schema
- Create the blog listing page
- Build dynamic routes for individual posts
- Add navigation to the site header
- Even fix the mobile menu when I realized the nav links were hidden on phones

All of this happened through text and voice commands while riding the bus. No IDE, no terminal—just conversation.

## Why This Matters

AI is changing how we build things. The barrier between "having an idea" and "shipping it" is getting smaller. I went from "I should add a blog" to having a fully functional blog in a single commute.

This is just the beginning. I'm excited to explore more ways to use AI for creative projects—especially for building out D&D campaigns and other creative work.

Stay tuned.
