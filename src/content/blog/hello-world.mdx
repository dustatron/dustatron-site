# Building This Blog From My Phone on the Bus

Here's something wild: this entire blog feature was implemented from my phone. No laptop, no desktop—just me on the bus home from work, typing commands into the Claude app.

## The Starting Point

I had already set up this site using an Astro template and wired it to auto-deploy via GitHub Pages. The portfolio was live, but I wanted to add a blog. Instead of waiting until I got home to my laptop, I decided to try something: could I build it from my phone?

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator. Blog posts are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX support), which means I can write content in simple markdown files and they automatically become pages on the site.

The whole thing is powered by:
- **Astro** - Fast static site generation
- **MDX** - Markdown files for blog posts
- **Content Collections** - Type-safe frontmatter and easy content management
- **Claude Code** - AI-assisted development
- **GitHub Pages** - Automatic deployment on merge

## The Process

Using Claude Code through the Claude app, I was able to:
- Add MDX support to the Astro config
- Set up content collections with a proper schema
- Create the blog listing page
- Build dynamic routes for individual posts
- Add navigation to the site header
- Even fix the mobile menu when I realized the nav links were hidden on phones

All of this happened through text and voice commands while riding the bus. No IDE, no terminal—just conversation.

There was some tedium in the process—I had to directly micromanage how Claude Code worked with branches and merging. Git operations required more hand-holding than I expected. But for the most part, it was pretty smooth and genuinely impressive. I went from "I should add a blog" to having a fully functional blog in a single commute.

This is just the beginning. I'm excited to explore more ways to use AI for creative projects—especially for building out D&D campaigns and other creative work.

Stay tuned.
