# Experiment Log: Building a Blog From My iPhone

**Location:** Metro 44 bus, en route home
**Equipment:** iPhone, Claude Code app
**Objective:** Ship a blog feature before reaching my stop

---

The site was already live—Astro template, GitHub Pages auto-deploy. But no blog. I wanted one. The laptop was at home. The bus ride was 20 minutes.

Hypothesis: I can build this from my phone.

**Results:**

Fifteen minutes. Blog listing page, dynamic post routes, site navigation updates. Even patched the mobile menu when I discovered the nav links were invisible on phones. All via text and voice commands to Claude Code.

**Complications:**

Git operations required more hand-holding than anticipated. Branches and merging needed direct micromanagement. Noted for future experiments.

**Conclusion:**

Hypothesis confirmed. The blog exists. You're reading it.
