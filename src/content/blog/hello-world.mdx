# Building This Blog From My Phone on the Bus

Built from my phone on the bus. No laptop—just the Claude Code app on my iPhone and a commute.

I already had this Astro site auto-deploying via GitHub Pages. Wanted a blog. Didn't want to wait until I got home.

Fifteen minutes later: blog listing page, dynamic post routes, navigation updates, even a mobile menu fix when I realized the nav was hidden on phones. All through text and voice commands.

Git was tedious—had to micromanage branches and merging more than expected. But the rest? Genuinely impressive.
