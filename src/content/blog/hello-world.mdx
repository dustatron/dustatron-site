# Welcome to My AI Adventures

I'm starting this blog to share my journey exploring AI tools and finding creative ways to use them.

## What I'm Exploring

- **D&D Campaign Building** - Using AI to generate lore, NPCs, encounter ideas, and world-building elements
- **Creative Experiments** - Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI assistance
- **New Tools & Techniques** - Documenting what I learn along the way

## Why Write About It?

AI is changing how we create. I want to document what works, what doesn't, and the surprising things I discover. Whether it's crafting a compelling villain backstory or generating a map for a dungeon crawl, there's so much to explore.

Stay tuned for more!
