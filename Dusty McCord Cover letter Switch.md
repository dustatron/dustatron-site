Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer (Front-End) role at Switch. With 5+ years building performant React and Next.js applications, I'm drawn to Switch's mission of enabling the technology of the future through world-class digital infrastructure.

At Apex Fintech Solutions, I've shipped multiple greenfield projects end-to-end using React, TypeScript, and modern tooling like Vite and Webpack. I've participated in major migrations—Angular to React, Redux to React Query and Zustand—giving me deep experience with both legacy codebases and cutting-edge patterns. I conduct daily code reviews, mentor new developers, and collaborate closely with backend teams on API design.

What excites me most about this role is Switch's emphasis on AI-assisted development. I've adopted agentic AI workflows using Claude Code to accelerate feature development and improve code quality—it's transformed how I work. I'd welcome the opportunity to help implement and promote these tools across your frontend team.

I also bring a strong testing mindset, having established E2E testing infrastructure (Cypress, later Playwright) and migrated unit testing from Jest to Vitest. I care deeply about building reliable, performant applications that scale.

I'd love to contribute to Switch's mission. Thanks for your consideration.

Best,
Dusty McCord
