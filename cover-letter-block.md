Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Design Engineer position at Block. With a decade of motion design experience and the past year shipping production code daily with agentic AI, I am drawn to a role that treats AI as a new medium rather than a bolt-on.

I have experimented with Goose to explore MCP servers and test models, and I appreciate that Block is investing in open-source tooling that advances the broader community. I want to contribute to that momentum.

At Apex Fintech Solutions, I use Claude Code daily to ship production features, write tests, and debug infrastructure. Many colleagues were initially skeptical of AI-assisted development. I won them over through practical demonstration—showing how agentic workflows could untangle messy rebases and reduce cognitive load. The best way to advocate for new tools is to build things that solve problems people actually face.

I am someone who loves to learn, build, and tell stories—frontend development scratches all three. I want to build tools that let more people do the same.

On my own time, I have built an agile poker app my team now uses for sprint planning, a status bar extension for Claude Code, and a generative AI party game. These projects share a common thread—empowering users to do more with less friction.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to tools that democratize craft at scale.

Sincerely,
Dusty McCord
