Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Frontend Software Engineer position on the Trust Web team. With 5+ years building React applications in fintech and a track record of shipping complex, high-stakes UIs, I am drawn to work that directly impacts how sellers onboard and succeed with Square.

At Apex Fintech Solutions, I build data-dense UIs for transfers, margin calls, and account management—flows with complicated steps, nuance, and guardrails. I have also maintained login patterns for Okta and Cognito, giving me direct experience with identity and trust-related systems. I understand what it takes to make complex financial workflows feel simple and reliable.

I led 3 major migrations serving 80,000 daily users and established our E2E testing infrastructure from scratch—first with Cypress, then Playwright. I care about performance, accessibility, and maintainability because I have seen what happens when teams skip those. I also use AI-enabled development tools daily to accelerate my workflow.

I am someone who loves to learn, build, and tell stories—frontend development scratches all three. I want to help more sellers get from signup to first payment with confidence.

On my own time, I have built an agile poker app my team now uses for sprint planning, and a full-stack app for tabletop RPG game masters. These projects share a common thread—taking complex workflows and making them simple.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Trust Web and help Square grow.

Sincerely,
Dusty McCord
